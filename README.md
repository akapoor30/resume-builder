(This project contains a Python-based resume builder app.)

Getting started
-----------------

1. Create a virtual environment (macOS / Linux / zsh):

```bash
cd /path/to/projects/resume-builder
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (if present in `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app or tests

```bash
# Example to run the app if applicable
python -m app.main
```

Notes
-----
- Deactivate the environment with `deactivate` when done.
- `.venv` is ignored by Git via `.gitignore`.

If you need a specific Python version or prefer `pyenv`/`conda`, use those tools for environment management instead.
