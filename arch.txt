🧪 STEP 2 CHECKPOINT — What Interviewers Love

If asked “Explain your project”, you’ll say:

“I designed a modular FastAPI system where resume parsing, job analysis, prompt engineering, and LLM interaction are separated using SOLID principles. This allows deterministic resume generation and easy extension to other roles or LLM providers.”
